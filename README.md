# Virtual_Paint
Virtual Paint using OpenCV and Python

Here i have made a Virtual Paint using Opencv and Python in which we can draw, or paint anything on the screen using our hands

There are 3 paint colours from which we can draw and an Eraser as well

There is a HandTrackingModule. This HandTrackingModule contains functions that will help in detecting our hands and fingers and also detecting which fingers are up
